I'm super excited to be learning GitHub. It is a must know thing going into becoming a developer.

Last night I found out that Git was actually created by the creator of Linux - Linus Torvalds!
Very impressive that he has created 2 revolutionary bits of tech.

I find this inspring and can't wait to be able to create useful apps and work on projects to create something meaningful.

### So far I have learnt **SOME**:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- C
- Batch

I still have a lot to learn. Everyday things start to make a little more sense and the pieces slowly come together.
The trick is to *never* stop learning.
